Language Implementation:

--array types
--pointer arithmetic
--resolvetype needs to allow the declaration of anonymous structural types
--function pointers
--vector types
--sane numeric casting rules for constants
--macros in terra
--calling lua functions from terra


--eval types:
   change types to have either canonical versions or exist as proxy objects
   type constructors (e.g. pointer to) should ask if a type is canonical and create a proxy if not)
   types should be presented in the AST as the string of lua code to run to get the type rather than an AST needed to be interpreted


Runtime Implementation:

-- how to save results for later (both Lua state and Terra JIT state)
-- how to use clang to read C header files

DONE:
--anonymous structural type cast to other structural types
--methods on types (declaration syntax )
--methods on types (call syntax/resolution) 
-- -> and & syntax need to work in normal lua code (not just type resolution)
