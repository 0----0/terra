Language Implementation:

--array types
--pointer arithmetic
--resolvetype needs to allow the declaration of anonymous structural types
--function pointers
-- -> and & syntax need to work in normal lua code (not just type resolution)
--vector types
--sane numeric casting rules for constants
--methods on types (declaration syntax )
--macros in terra
--calling lua functions from terra

Runtime Implementation:

-- how to save results for later (both Lua state and Terra JIT state)
-- how to use clang to read C header files

DONE:
--anonymous structural type cast to other structural types

--methods on types (call syntax/resolution)
